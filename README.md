# News Site

This project was a school assignment to create our very first news site. The assignment involved using basic HTML, CSS and media queries to create a responsive design.


## The problem

The task was to create a header, a main news article and a grid of news articles with different requirements for mobile, tablet and desktop views. I managed to do this by sketching up my website on paper first, then went on to VS Code to write the HTML code for the different elements. To create the layout and design I wanted I used Flexbox and CSS Grid. By using the inspect tool in Google Chrome I was able to look at my design and how it behaved with the media queries. 

If I would have had more time I would have wanted to include links to the navbar and work more with the hamburger menu. For the next project I will definitely start with the design for mobile version first, as I think it it would make the coding process easier. During this assignment I started out focusing on the desktop view, and midway through switched to having mobile view as my base, wich caused me some unnecessary headache.
